Steps to start mongoDB

If you are unsure which init system your platform uses, run the following command:
	ps --no-headers -o comm 1

You can start the mongod process by issuing the following command:
	sudo systemctl start mongod
	
If failed, run:
	sudo systemctl daemon-reload
	
Verify that MongoDB has started successfully:
	sudo systemctl status mongod
	
You can optionally ensure that MongoDB will start following a system reboot by issuing the following command:
	sudo systemctl enable mongod

Stop MongoDB:
	sudo systemctl stop mongod

Restart MongoDB:
	sudo systemctl restart mongod

Begin using MongoDB:
	mongo
